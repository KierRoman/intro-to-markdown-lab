>HTML Boilerplate is the inital set up for all HTML documents. A boilerplate in HTML is a template you will add at the start of your project. You should add this boilerplate to all of your HTML pages.
## Setup
HTML Boilerplate is foundational for writing all HTML documets. In this section we will demonstrate how to set up the boilerplate that makes up most documents.
* The first thing you will need is the initial framing. This typically includes the main sections, Header, Body and Footer.
* You will also notice the *!DOCTYPE* in the beginning. This is a default for most HTML. The boilerplate also includes meta data that won't materialize actively on the page but controls the environmet itself.

 Heres whats this all would look like coded.

```Javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
</html>
```
###### *If you notice the "Document" are will populate at the top of your browser but not on the viewport.*

## *Links*
When you are formating documents in HTML sometimes the document needs certain kinds of design or layout. CSS paired with HTML makes some of the more pleasant webpages. 

Linking to your CSS is simple using the boilerplate area to link your stylesheet from your system.
```javascript
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```
This is just a short descriptor by a pretty low-level coder. For more insight to how these work you can find help in the [MDN docs.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
